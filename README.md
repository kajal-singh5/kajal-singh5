### Education and Experience
I hold a B.com (Hons) degree, which has provided me with a strong foundation in business and finance. Alongside my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable experience as an audit assistant, where I developed a keen eye for detail and a systematic approach to problem-solving. 

My journey into the tech industry began with my role as a UX/UI designer, where I explored the intersection of creativity and user-centered design. This experience allowed me to conceptualize and craft engaging digital experiences that prioritize usability and aesthetics. 

As a product manager intern, I had the opportunity to work closely with cross-functional teams, bridging the gap between design, development, and business objectives. This role helped me understand the importance of effective communication, collaboration, and strategic decision-making in delivering successful products. 


### Coding Bootcamp and Front-End Expertise
Currently, I am enrolled in a coding bootcamp, where I am immersing myself in various programming languages such as Java and JavaScript. Through hands-on projects, I am gaining practical experience in front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, and responsive design. I am excited to bring my design background and creativity to the development process, as I work on converting my designs into reality.
